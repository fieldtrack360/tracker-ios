# Tracker for iOS

Background location tracking and track plotting. iOS 17+, Swift 6.

Tracker records a location trace that survives backgrounding and termination,
filters it through a Kalman filter and a staged acceptance pipeline, and turns
the result into a plotted track you can render. It ships as five binary
frameworks; hosts never receive source.

```
TrackerSync → TrackerCore → TrackerGeo ← TrackerMaps, TrackerSnap
```

| Product | Required? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TrackerCore` | yes | Capture, storage, background execution, permissions. The SDK. |
| `TrackerGeo` | comes with every product | The engine's public types — `TrackPoint`, `Track`, `MotionState` |
| `TrackerMaps` | optional | MapKit rendering for a finished track and a live one |
| `TrackerSnap` | optional | OSRM map matching behind `RoadSnapProvider` |
| `TrackerSync` | optional | Upload with a retry queue and 401 teardown |

---

## Install

In Xcode: **File ▸ Add Package Dependencies…**, then paste

```
https://github.com/fieldtrack360/tracker-ios
```

Or in a `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/fieldtrack360/tracker-ios", from: "1.0.1")
```

Add only the products you need. Because these are binary targets, each product
already carries the targets it depends on — adding `TrackerCore` gives you
`TrackerGeo` too.

## Host configuration

**This is not optional.** Without it the SDK cannot capture in the background,
and `BGTaskScheduler.register` raises an Objective-C exception no Swift `catch`
can reach.

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Records your route while you are using the app.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Records your route in the background so your trips are complete even when the app is closed.</string>
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>Detects when you start and stop moving, to save battery.</string>

<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>location</string>
    <string>processing</string>
</array>

<key>BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers</key>
<array>
    <string>com.fieldtrack360.tracker.backstop</string>
    <string>com.fieldtrack360.tracker.sync</string>
</array>
```

The identifiers must appear **verbatim**. A mismatch is not a degraded backstop;
it is an exception at registration.

---

## Quick start

`ready()` belongs in your `App` initialiser, not in a view's `.task`. It
registers the background task handler, and registering after launch completes
throws.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import TrackerCore

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    init() {
        Task { _ = await Tracker.shared.ready() }
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup { ContentView() }
    }
}
```

Then ask for permission and start a run:

```swift
import TrackerCore

@MainActor
func beginTracking() async {
    // The ladder is ordered. Always can only be requested from When-In-Use.
    let tier = await Tracker.shared.permissions().requestWhenInUse()
    guard tier != .none else { return }

    switch await Tracker.shared.permissions().requestAlways() {
    case .alreadyGranted, .granted:
        break
    case .needsWhenInUseFirst, .denied:
        return                      // capture still works in the foreground
    case .needsSettings(let url):
        await UIApplication.shared.open(url)
        return
    @unknown default:
        return
    }

    switch await Tracker.shared.start(tag: "delivery-run") {
    case .success(let session):
        print("recording \(session.id)")
    case .failure(let code, let message):
        print("refused — \(code.rawValue): \(message)")
    @unknown default:
        break
    }
}
```

Stop when the run ends:

```swift
_ = await Tracker.shared.stop()
```

### `TrackerResult`, and why `@unknown default`

The SDK never throws into your task from a fallible entry point; it returns
`TrackerResult<T>`, which is `.success(T)` or `.failure(code:message:)`.

Every public enum is **non-frozen**, because this ships as a binary with library
evolution enabled. Your `switch` needs `@unknown default` so a newer SDK adding
a case does not break your build. Fold the unknown into the conservative branch —
an outcome you cannot read is not evidence that something succeeded.

---

## Permissions

**The SDK shows no UI.** `Tracker.shared.permissions()` hands back a
`PermissionManager` that raises the system prompts and answers questions about
them; the rationale screen, the copy and the Settings fallback stay in your app.
A location prompt is product copy — a library that presents its own alert cannot
be localised by you, cannot be A/B tested, and appears at whatever moment the SDK
happened to be initialised.

What follows is the whole surface. A host with its own UI layer — an onboarding
flow, a settings screen, a cross-platform bridge — needs to reach exactly these
members and nothing more.

### Requesting

| Method | Returns | |
|---|---|---|
| `requestWhenInUse()` | `AuthorizationTier` | Rung 1. Ask this first, always |
| `requestAlways()` | `BackgroundRequest` | Rung 3. Reachable only *from* When-In-Use, and iOS raises it at most once |
| `requestMotion()` | `MotionAuthorization` | Optional, and last. Denial is not fatal |
| `requestTemporaryFullAccuracy(purposeKey:)` | `LocationAccuracy` | Precise Location for this session only, without changing the user's global setting |

All four are `async` and `@MainActor`. Each **returns immediately with the
current answer** when iOS would not prompt, rather than suspending on a callback
that is never coming.

`requestMotion()` has no request API behind it — CoreMotion raises consent on
first use — so it asks the activity history for an empty window. The alert comes
from the call, not the range, so the window costs nothing.

`purposeKey` must exist in your `NSLocationTemporaryUsageDescriptionDictionary`.
When it does not, iOS resolves the request with an error and the accuracy is
unchanged, which is why the answer is re-read from CoreLocation rather than
inferred from the absence of an error.

### Reading

| Member | Returns | |
|---|---|---|
| `tier()` | `AuthorizationTier` | `.none` / `.whenInUse` / `.always`. `.denied` and `.restricted` both read as `.none` |
| `accuracy()` | `LocationAccuracy` | `.full` / `.reduced` |
| `motionAuthorization()` | `MotionAuthorization` | `.notDetermined` / `.denied` / `.restricted` / `.authorized` |
| `shouldStopAsking(attempts:)` | `Bool` | Whether your UI should offer Settings instead of another prompt. You own the counter, because you own the prompts |
| `settingsURL` | `URL` | Where to send a user whose answer only Settings can change. **The SDK never opens it itself** |

**Re-read all three states on every foreground.** Each moves underneath a running
app: the user can revoke location in Settings, downgrade a provisional Always
days after granting it, or switch Precise Location off without touching the tier.

### The order is load-bearing

1. `requestWhenInUse()`
2. **your own rationale**, in your words, on your screen
3. `requestAlways()`
4. `requestMotion()`

iOS raises the Always prompt **at most once**, and only *from* When-In-Use.
Asking for it from `.notDetermined` — or asking for both in the same breath —
loses background tracking for that install permanently, with no recovery except
convincing the user to visit Settings.

Rung 3 without rung 2 is the same loss by a slower route: a user who has not been
told what the prompt is for taps "Keep Only While Using", and there is no second
prompt. Motion goes last so its alert does not stack on top of a location alert.

### `requestAlways()` answers five ways, not two

| Case | What it means |
|---|---|
| `alreadyGranted` | Already on Always — including the provisional grant iOS makes with no prompt at all. **The absence of a prompt is not a denial** |
| `granted` | The user chose "Change to Always" |
| `denied` | Location is denied or restricted outright |
| `needsWhenInUseFirst` | The SDK refused to ask, because the app is not on When-In-Use. Climb rung 1 and try again — nothing is lost |
| `needsSettings(URL)` | iOS will not raise the prompt again. Show your explanation, then offer the URL |

Flattening this to a `Bool` throws away the two cases that decide what your UI
does next. Anything that carries the answer across a boundary — a view model, a
bridge to another language — should carry the case and the URL, not a yes/no.

### Precise Location is not a rung

The user sets it independently of the tier, so it gates nothing and nothing gates
it: Always can be granted with Precise Location off. It matters anyway — a 1–3 km
error circle defeats every gate in the acceptance pipeline, so `start()` refuses
`.continuous` and `.adaptive` under `.reduced` instead of recording a track
nobody can trust. Read it with `accuracy()`, then either send the user to
`settingsURL` or ask for `requestTemporaryFullAccuracy(purposeKey:)`.

### Ask through the SDK, not around it

iOS silently no-ops a second Always request: the status never changes, so the
delegate callback never arrives. `PermissionManager` records that it asked —
across launches, before the prompt goes up rather than after — and turns the
second call into `needsSettings` instead of awaiting an answer iOS has no
intention of sending.

A third-party permissions library asking for Always behind the SDK's back leaves
that record unset, and the next `requestAlways()` waits on a prompt that will
never appear. Route the location rungs through `permissions()` and this cannot
happen.

### A worked ladder

`Examples/SampleApp/Modules/Home/PermissionLadderView.swift` is the whole thing in one
file: four rungs, each disabled until its predecessor is satisfied, and every
disabled control saying *why* it is disabled. It depends on nothing but
`Tracker.shared.permissions()`. Copy it.

---

## Observing what happens

`events()` is the live stream. Handling every case is the point: a handler that
covers four of eleven makes silence meaningless.

```swift
import TrackerCore
import TrackerGeo

func observe() async {
    for await event in Tracker.shared.events() {
        switch event {
        case .location(let point):
            print("accepted \(point.latitude),\(point.longitude) ±\(point.accuracyM)m")
        case .locationRejected(let decision):
            print("rejected — \(decision.reason)")
        case .motionChange(let state, _):
            print("motion \(state)")
        case .activityChange(let activity, let confidence):
            print("activity \(activity) @\(confidence)")
        case .providerChange(let state):
            print("authorization \(state.authorization.rawValue)")
        case .batteryChange(let battery):
            print("battery \(battery.percent ?? -1)%")
        case .enabledChange, .heartbeat, .powerSaveChange, .diagnostic:
            break
        case .sessionInterrupted(let session):
            print("interrupted \(session.id)")
        case .licenseDeactivated(let status, let reason):
            // Tracking has ALREADY stopped. Show your message here.
            print("licence \(status): \(reason ?? "no reason given")")
        case .trackingGap(let durationSec, let distanceMeters):
            // Capture was off while the device moved — usually a force-quit.
            print("tracking gap: \(durationSec)s, moved at least \(Int(distanceMeters))m")
        case .error(let code, let message):
            print("error \(code.rawValue): \(message)")
        @unknown default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```

`decision.reason` is a stable vocabulary, not free text — it is what makes a
field report diagnosable. Treat it as API.

### Permission and device state, on demand

The event stream tells you when things change; these answer "what is true
right now" — for a settings or tracking-health screen:

```swift
// The rung the app is on: .none / .whenInUse / .always.
let tier = await Tracker.shared.authorizationTier()

// The full snapshot: authorization, precise location, Location Services,
// Low Power Mode.
let provider = await Tracker.shared.currentProviderState()

// Or subscribe to every change of that snapshot as a stream.
for await state in Tracker.shared.providerState() {
    print("authorization now \(state.authorization.rawValue)")
}

// What the hardware and granted permissions actually make possible —
// re-probed on every call, because motion consent moves under a running app.
let sensors = Tracker.shared.getSensors()
```

---

## Reading the data

```swift
import TrackerCore
import TrackerGeo

func summarise(sessionID: String) async throws {
    let points: [TrackPoint] = try await Tracker.shared.getPoints(
        PointQuery(sessionID: sessionID)
    )
    let count = try await Tracker.shared.getCount(PointQuery(sessionID: sessionID))
    let metres = try await Tracker.shared.getOdometerMeters()

    print("\(count) points, \(metres) m")
    print("first: \(points.first?.timeMs ?? 0)")

    let sessions = try await Tracker.shared.getSessions()
    print("\(sessions.count) sessions, open: \(sessions.filter(\.isOpen).count)")
}
```

`PointQuery` pages by default, so pass `limit`/`offset` for long runs rather
than pulling everything into memory.

Two more reads worth knowing:

```swift
// The session currently recording, or nil.
let open = try await Tracker.shared.currentSession()

// A fresh list on every change to a session's points — drive SwiftUI from this
// while recording, instead of polling getPoints.
for await points in Tracker.shared.observePoints(sessionID: sessionID) {
    print("now \(points.count) points")
}
```

---

## One fix, without tracking

`getCurrentLocation()` answers "where am I now" without opening a session — for
a map centre, an address lookup or a check-in. It needs `ready()` and nothing
else; `start()` is not required.

```swift
import TrackerCore

func centreOnUser() async {
    switch await Tracker.shared.getCurrentLocation() {
    case .success(let fix):
        print("\(fix.latitude), \(fix.longitude) ±\(fix.accuracyM) m")
    case .failure(let code, let message):
        // The code says which of the four causes it was; the message carries
        // the specifics — authorization, location services, reduced accuracy,
        // low-power mode.
        print("\(code.rawValue): \(message)")
    // Required: TrackerResult is non-frozen across the binary boundary.
    @unknown default:
        print("unrecognised result")
    }
}
```

It runs on a second `CLLocationManager`, so calling it during a session cannot
disturb the live stream.

### `feedIngestor` is optional, and defaults to `true`

The parameter picks between the call's two jobs. The capture is identical either
way — one `requestLocation()` — and only what happens afterwards differs:

| Call | What happens |
|---|---|
| `getCurrentLocation()` | The fix comes back **and** is handed to the one ingest consumer: judged by the same seven gates as a streamed fix, then stored as a point on the session that is recording. **This is the default** |
| `getCurrentLocation(feedIngestor: false)` | The fix comes back and nothing else is touched |

Pass `false` when you only want to read the position — a map centre or an
address lookup — because with the default a screen that asks "where am I" adds a
point to the user's track every time it opens. With no session open there is no
track for the point to land on, so the flag makes no difference there.

Neither setting bypasses anything: a fed fix is judged by the same pipeline, so
a one-shot cannot inject an unvalidated point.

### Failures name their own cause

Only one of the four is worth retrying, so each carries its own code:

| Code | Cause | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `notReady` | `ready()` was not called | Call it, from the `App` initialiser |
| `fixTimeout` | No fix inside `oneShotTimeoutMs` | Retry is reasonable. The message carries the device state: authorization, location services, accuracy grant, low-power mode |
| `oneShotBusy` | A capture is already in flight | **Do not retry.** Await the one running; a second call collides again |
| `oneShotCircuitOpen` | Three consecutive failures opened the circuit | **Do not retry.** Further calls fail immediately, until location authorization is granted, location services come back, or a session starts |
| `fixRejected` | A fix arrived and was refused at the mapping boundary — mock-location policy or the staleness ceiling | Read the message. It is the only account there is: this refusal happens before the pipeline, so no decision row is written |

The circuit exists to stop burning wake-ups on a device that cannot produce a
fix. Treating any of the last three as "retry later" is what it is there to
prevent.

## Manual pace override

`changePace(isMoving:)` forces the motion machine into moving or stationary,
overriding what the sensors think. It is the escape hatch for the case
autonomous detection cannot win: indoors, in a car park, in a lift lobby,
CoreMotion can sit on `.still` while the user is demonstrably about to drive
away — and your app often knows better, because the user just tapped "Start
trip", or a job was accepted, or a geofence just fired.

```swift
await Tracker.shared.start(tag: "trip")

// Commit to moving now, rather than waiting for CoreMotion to agree.
await Tracker.shared.changePace(isMoving: true)

// ...and settle to stationary the way a confirmed stop does.
await Tracker.shared.changePace(isMoving: false)
```

- **`true` bypasses `motionTriggerDelaySec`.** A host asserting motion is not a
  hint to be corroborated.
- **Idempotent.** Asserting a state the machine is already in is a no-op and
  emits nothing, so it is safe to call on every tap without an event storm.
- **Needs an open session.** Without one it returns `.failure(.notReady)`
  rather than silently accepting something it cannot do.

---

## Geofences

Circular regions with your own identifier. `addGeofence` needs `ready()` and
location authorization — **not** a session: a fence fires whether or not you are
recording a track, and keeps firing after `stop()`.

```swift
import TrackerCore

func watchTheDepot() async {
    let depot = Geofence(
        id: "depot-7",                  // yours; it comes back on every crossing
        latitude: 23.0225,
        longitude: 72.5714,
        radiusM: 200,
        notifyOnEntry: true,
        notifyOnExit: true
    )

    switch await Tracker.shared.addGeofence(depot) {
    case .success(let armed):
        // The radius comes back clamped to what the OS will monitor, so this
        // describes the fence that exists rather than the one you asked for.
        print("armed \(armed.id) at \(armed.radiusM) m")
    case .failure(_, let message):
        print(message)
    @unknown default:
        break
    }
}
```

**A fence armed around where you already are fires `enter` immediately.**
CoreLocation reports transitions only, so without this a fence created at your
current position would report nothing until you left and came back — and its
dwell, which hangs off the entry, could never start.

Managing them:

```swift
let fences = await Tracker.shared.getGeofences()          // read back from the OS
await Tracker.shared.removeGeofence(id: "depot-7")        // false if not found
await Tracker.shared.removeAllGeofences()                 // returns how many
```

Every arm and disarm also reaches `events()`, for a screen that watches the set
rather than the call:

```swift
case .geofenceAdded(let fence):
    // The fence as it exists — the radius is the clamped one. Emitted after
    // CoreLocation acknowledges the region, so getGeofences() already sees it.
    print("armed \(fence.id) at \(fence.radiusM) m")

case .geofenceRemoved(let id):
    print("disarmed \(id)")
```

Re-arming an identifier that already exists emits `geofenceAdded` again — the
replacement is a new fence under the same name, and its dwell starts from that
moment. `removeAllGeofences()` emits one `geofenceRemoved` per fence rather than
one for the batch, and removing an unknown id emits nothing, the same way it
returns `false`.

### Crossings arrive two ways, and you need both

While your app is running, `events()` carries them live:

```swift
for await event in Tracker.shared.events() {
    switch event {
    case .geofenceEnter(let crossing):
        print("entered \(crossing.geofenceID) at \(crossing.timeMs)")
    case .geofenceExit(let crossing):
        print("left \(crossing.geofenceID)")
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

**iOS relaunches a terminated app to deliver a crossing**, and at that moment
nothing is subscribed yet — the event stream has no replay. Every crossing is
therefore also written to disk. Read it at launch:

```swift
// Everything since you last looked, newest first.
let crossings = try await Tracker.shared.getGeofenceEvents(limit: 50)

// Or one fence's history.
let depotVisits = try await Tracker.shared.getGeofenceEvents(geofenceID: "depot-7")

// History is kept when a fence is removed. Drop it explicitly:
try await Tracker.shared.deleteGeofenceEvents(geofenceID: "depot-7")
```

### What the platform imposes

| | |
|---|---|
| **20 regions per app** | Shared with anything you monitor yourself; the SDK reserves one for its own stationary fence, so 19 are available. Going over returns a failure naming the cap. |
| **~100 m minimum radius** | Smaller regions fire unreliably or not at all. A smaller fence is accepted and emits `.diagnostic("geofence_radius_below_reliable_minimum")`. |
| **Always authorization** | Needed to wake a terminated app. Under When-In-Use a fence still works in the foreground and emits `.backgroundPermissionMissing`. |
| **Re-using an id replaces** | Adding under an identifier already in use moves that fence, with no window where neither exists. |

Geofences survive termination and reboot because iOS owns the monitoring, not
this SDK. `getGeofences()` reads them back from the system rather than from a
list of our own, so what you see is what is actually armed.


### Dwell — "still there after N minutes"

iOS has no dwell transition: `CLCircularRegion` reports entry and exit and
nothing else, and unlike Android there is no service outside your process
holding a loitering timer. The SDK synthesises it, and what that costs you is
timing rather than truth.

```swift
let site = Geofence(
    id: "site-42",
    latitude: 23.0225,
    longitude: 72.5714,
    radiusM: 200,
    dwellAfterMs: 10 * 60_000        // nil = no dwell
)
_ = await Tracker.shared.addGeofence(site)

for await event in Tracker.shared.events() {
    if case .geofenceDwell(let dwell) = event {
        print("on site since \(dwell.timeMs)")
    }
}
```

The condition is evaluated at every moment the SDK is already awake — a timer
while the app lives, the health tick, the background task, and at the next
launch:

| App state | When the dwell fires |
|---|---|
| Foreground, or background with a session | On time |
| Suspended | Late — when iOS next runs the background task |
| Terminated | At the next launch, or when the exit crossing relaunches it |

**The recorded event is accurate even when delivery is late.** Its `timeMs` is
the moment the condition was met — entry plus your delay — not the moment the
SDK noticed. A dwell reported at 15:10 for a condition met at 14:32 says 14:32,
because "how long has the driver been on site" has one true answer.

It fires **once per visit**; leaving and returning starts it again. On the
paths that may run long after the fact, the SDK takes a one-shot fix to confirm
the device really is still inside before reporting — an exit iOS failed to
deliver would otherwise become a dwell that never happened.

---

## Plotting a track

`buildTrack` runs the whole plotting plane — consolidation, simplification,
smoothing, arrow placement — and returns a `Track` ready to draw.

```swift
import TrackerCore
import TrackerGeo

func exportRun(sessionID: String) async throws {
    let track: Track = try await Tracker.shared.buildTrack(
        PointQuery(sessionID: sessionID)
    )
    let geoJSON: String = try await Tracker.shared.exportGeoJSON(
        PointQuery(sessionID: sessionID)
    )
    print("track v\(track.version), \(geoJSON.count) bytes of GeoJSON")
}
```

`exportPolylineJSON` is the sibling export: the same `Track`, JSON-encoded
with its polyline intact, for a backend that decodes polylines itself.

### Rendering it (`TrackerMaps`)

`TrackMapView` consumes the placement the engine already computed rather than
recomputing it, so what you see is what the engine decided.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import TrackerGeo
import TrackerMaps

struct TrackScreen: View {
    let track: Track

    var body: some View {
        TrackMapView(track: track)
            .ignoresSafeArea()
    }
}
```

### When tracking was off — capture gaps

iOS never relaunches a force-quit app for location events. If the user swipes
your app away and then drives, capture resumes only when they next open it, and
the track has a hole in it that no filter change can fill.

The SDK names the hole rather than papering over it:

```swift
case .trackingGap(let durationSec, let distanceMeters):
    banner("Tracking was off for \(durationSec / 60) min. "
         + "Please don't swipe the app away.")
```

Emitted once, on the first stored point after the silence, when capture was
quiet for **at least 10 minutes** and resumed **at least 250 m away**. Both
conditions are required, and that is what keeps an ordinary parked night out of
it: sitting still for twelve hours is drift suppression working, not an outage.

The same span appears on the built track as a third segment type:

```swift
for segment in track.segments where segment.type == .gap {
    // durationSec: how long nothing was captured
    // distanceMeters: the straight line between the last point before
    //                 and the first point after — a LOWER BOUND
}
```

`TrackMapView` draws it dashed and grey, and splits the solid route line around
it, because a span nobody observed must not read as a driven route. A `.gap`
carries no speed band, no activity, no arrows and no stop node, and it
contributes nothing to `TrackStats.totalDistanceMeters` — that number sums what
was observed.

**The odometer makes the opposite choice on purpose.** `TrackPoint.odometerM`
credits the straight-line leg across a gap, because distance travelled is still
distance travelled. The two numbers answer different questions — "how far has
this device gone" versus "how far did we watch it go" — and forcing them to
agree would falsify one of them.

`SegmentType` is not frozen, so a `switch` over it needs `@unknown default`.

### Following a run as it happens

```swift
import SwiftUI
import TrackerCore
import TrackerGeo
import TrackerMaps

struct LiveScreen: View {
    @State private var update: LiveTrackUpdate?

    var body: some View {
        LiveTrackMapView(update: update)
            .ignoresSafeArea()
            .task {
                for await next in Tracker.shared.liveTrack() {
                    self.update = next
                }
            }
    }
}
```

### Navigating a planned route

If your app is navigating a route it already knows, hand it to the SDK and
the live puck snaps to it — stored points and `buildTrack` are untouched:

```swift
await Tracker.shared.setActiveRoute(routePoints)   // [GeoPoint]; empty clears it

// True once the position has missed the route for enough consecutive fixes
// to be a wrong turn rather than a GPS spike.
if await Tracker.shared.isOffRoute() {
    recalculate()
}
```

---

## Optional: snapping to roads (`TrackerSnap`)

Give it an OSRM endpoint you control. There is no default URL on purpose — a
URL that "just works" is worth very little next to a rate limit somebody else
pays for.

```swift
import TrackerCore
import TrackerSnap

func enableSnapping(endpoint: URL) {
    Tracker.shared.setRoadSnapProvider(
        OSRMSnapProvider(baseURL: endpoint, profile: "driving")
    )
}
```

Snapping applies when a track is built; capture is unaffected.

## Optional: uploading (`TrackerSync`)

Configure it in your `App` initialiser alongside `ready()`, so the retry trigger
is registered before launch completes.

```swift
import TrackerCore
import TrackerSync

func configureSync(endpoint: URL, token: String) async {
    var config = SyncConfig(url: endpoint)
    config.headers["Authorization"] = "Bearer \(token)"
    config.autoSync = true
    config.batchSize = 200

    SyncEngine.shared.configure(config, store: Tracker.shared.pendingUploads)

    // The third trigger: rows left queued by a failed upload, with no new
    // point coming to wake anything else. Without it, a parked queue stays
    // parked until the next fix arrives.
    await Tracker.shared.setSyncTrigger(SyncEngine.shared.healthLoopTrigger())
}
```

Uploading is not tracking: no failure here stops capture or closes a session.
The single exception is opt-in and off by default —
`SyncConfig.stopTrackingOnAuthExpiry`.

### The request body

Two levels: `location` carries the batch, and anything you put in
`SyncConfig.extraParams` sits beside it.

```json
{
  "company_id": 42,
  "device_label": "van-7",
  "location": [
    {
      "uuid": "u-1",
      "time": 1787206701455,
      "local_date": "2026-08-24",
      "time_zone": "Asia/Kolkata",
      "latitude": 23.113114,
      "longitude": 72.538084,
      "accuracy": 4.98,
      "movementSpeed": 4.5,
      "hasSpeed": true,
      "hasBearing": true,
      "activity_status": "gps@moving",
      "detected_activity_type": "inVehicle",
      "detected_activity_start_time": 1,
      "battery_percentage": "75",
      "is_charging": true,
      "is_show_pin": "No",
      "is_mock": false,
      "provider": {
        "network": false,
        "gps": true,
        "enabled": true,
        "status": 3,
        "accuracyAuthorization": 0,
        "airplane": false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Extra params** are for what belongs to the *request* rather than to any point —
a tenant id, a device label, an API version — and that a header cannot carry
because your endpoint reads its body:

```swift
config.extraParams = [
    "company_id": .int(42),
    "device_label": .string("van-7"),
]
```

`SyncValue` is a closed set — `.string`, `.int`, `.double`, `.bool`, `.null`,
`.array`, `.object` — so anything you can build is guaranteed to encode. A
payload that failed to encode would be a batch retrying forever inside a
background task. `location` is refused: it is the batch itself, and a host that
overwrote it would have its points marked uploaded having never been sent.

**`provider` is an object**, in the same shape both SDKs send, so one backend
reads either. Two fields cannot mean on iOS quite what they mean on Android:

| Field | On iOS |
|---|---|
| `gps` / `network` | iOS exposes no provider identity, so this uses the pipeline's own rule: a fix with neither hardware speed nor course is network positioning (EC-32). The same test the acceptance pipeline gates on |
| `enabled` | Location Services, the device-wide switch |
| `status` | `0` not determined, `1` restricted, `2` denied, `3` always, `4` when-in-use |
| `accuracyAuthorization` | `0` full, `1` reduced |
| `airplane` | **There is no public API for the switch.** Derived from the network path having no usable interface, which is what airplane mode looks like from inside the sandbox — and also what no coverage with Wi-Fi off looks like. Read it as "the radios are unreachable" |

The provider snapshot is read **once per drain**, so it describes the device at
upload rather than at capture. A batch queued while offline can be hours old.

**`is_charging` is `Bool?`.** `null` on the simulator, on a Mac, and on a device
with battery monitoring off — `null` is not `false`, and the key is always
present so the object's shape never depends on the data.

### Surviving a cold start

**`SyncEngine` holds the configuration in memory only.** The queued points are on
disk and survive anything, but the endpoint, the headers and the policy do not —
so after a force-kill the app relaunches with `isConfigured == false`, a full
queue and nothing to explain it. Call `configure` on every launch.

`SyncConfig` is `Codable` so the argument can come back from wherever you keep
it, rather than from a login the user has to repeat:

```swift
// When you first configure — or whenever the token is refreshed.
let data = try JSONEncoder().encode(config)
// → your Keychain wrapper

// In your App initialiser, every launch.
if let data = try? myKeychain.read("sync-config"),
   let config = try? JSONDecoder().decode(SyncConfig.self, from: data) {
    SyncEngine.shared.configure(config, store: Tracker.shared.pendingUploads)
}
```

Decoding needs `url` and nothing else — every other key falls back to its
documented default, so a config stored by one version of the SDK still decodes
under the next.

Two things to get right:

- **Keychain, not `UserDefaults`.** `headers` is encoded verbatim, bearer token
  and all, and `UserDefaults` is a plist inside the app container.
- **Delete your stored copy when you see `.authExpired`.** That event means a 401
  tore the uploader down against a credential the server has already rejected;
  restoring it on the next launch earns the same 401 for the life of the install.
  It is also the only way to tell a teardown by 401 from a teardown by process
  death — one is an event you were told about.

Persisting is deliberately left to you. Where a credential lives is your
decision, not the SDK's, and a token the SDK resurrected from disk on its own
would contradict the 401 teardown it is supposed to respect.

Watch it:

```swift
import TrackerSync

func observeSync() async {
    for await event in SyncEngine.shared.events() {
        switch event {
        // One per HTTP exchange, before the outcome below — success, failure and
        // 401 alike. `statusCode` is nil when the request never reached a server:
        // offline, DNS, TLS.
        case .httpResponse(let statusCode, let count):
            print("server said \(statusCode.map(String.init) ?? "nothing") for \(count) points")

        case .uploaded(let count):
            print("\(count) points uploaded")

        case .retryScheduled(let afterSec, let reason):
            print("retrying in \(afterSec)s — \(reason)")

        case .authExpired:
            // Terminal. Refresh the credential and configure again — and throw
            // away any stored SyncConfig, or the next launch restores a token
            // the server has already rejected.
            print("credential is dead; the uploader has torn itself down")

        @unknown default:
            break
        }
    }
}
```

Triggering an upload by hand:

```swift
// Awaits the outcome — .uploaded(count:), .empty, .retry(reason:) or .authExpired.
let result = await SyncEngine.shared.syncNow()

// Or fire and forget; repeated calls coalesce.
SyncEngine.shared.requestSync()
```

**For the full request and response, own the exchange.** `SyncTransport` is a
protocol you can implement — your `URLSession`, your headers, your auth refresh,
the whole `HTTPURLResponse` and body — and hand to `configure(transport:)`. The
event stream reports what happened; the transport lets you decide what happens.

```swift
struct MyTransport: SyncTransport {
    func upload(_ request: SyncRequest) async -> SyncResponse {
        // request.url, request.headers, request.body are yours
        // return .success(code:) / .unauthorized / .failure(code:message:)
    }
}
```

---

## Configuration

Defaults are field-tuned; change them only with a reason. Pass a config to
`ready()`:

```swift
import TrackerCore

func readyWithConfig() async {
    var config = TrackerConfig()
    config.geolocation.accuracy.profile = .balanced
    config.geolocation.adaptiveCadence = true
    config.motion.stopTimeoutMin = 2
    config.persistence.maxDaysToPersist = 30
    config.persistence.persistDecisions = true

    _ = await Tracker.shared.ready(config)
}
```

Tune accuracy through `AccuracyProfile` rather than raw thresholds. The
thresholds themselves are internal on purpose: they are the field-tuned part,
and a profile is the supported way to move them.

`stopTimeoutMin` is stated in **minutes**. A config persisted by an earlier
version under `stopTimeoutSec` still decodes — the seconds are converted and
rounded up to whole minutes.

Six optional switches, all defaulting to the behaviour the SDK already had:

| Field | Default | What turning it on does |
|---|---|---|
| `motion.stopOnStationary` | `false` | Ends the session itself when the machine settles — a real `stop()`, for a job-per-trip app |
| `motion.disableStopDetection` | `false` | Never settles to stationary, for a host that must keep a live position while parked |
| `persistence.persistHeartbeat` | `false` | Stores the stationary heartbeat instead of discarding it — proof of presence, at ~32 rows per 8-hour stop |
| `sensors.useAccelerometerVeto` | `false` | Second stillness signal for devices with no pedometer (iPads, older hardware) |
| `sensors.useBarometer` | `false` | Reports vertical motion, so a lift is not read as standing still |
| `sensors.activityRecognitionIntervalMs` | `0` | Throttles activity updates. Saves no battery — iOS classifies regardless; it is for hosts whose own handler is expensive |

### How sure the phone has to be

iOS classifies what the device is doing — walking, driving, still — and attaches
a confidence to each reading. The SDK maps CoreMotion's three levels onto a
0–100 scale so the bars stay readable in config: low is `33`, medium is `66`,
high is `100`.

Three fields set those bars:

| Field | Default | The bar it sets |
|---|---|---|
| `motion.activityConfidenceMin` | `66` | The general bar for live readings. At the default a low-confidence guess is ignored and medium or better is accepted |
| `motion.snapshotConfidenceMin` | `50` | The bar for history read back after a gap. Looser on purpose — a recovered segment beats no segment |
| `motion.stillConfidenceMin` | `100` | Applies to `.still` only, and *after* the general bar. At the default only a high-confidence still may start a stop |

`stillConfidenceMin` sits at the top of the scale for a reason. CoreMotion
reports `.still` at low and medium confidence throughout ordinary movement — the
moment between strides, a gear change, a red light — often once a second. Each
one is a true reading of a device that was, for that instant, not moving; none
of them means the journey ended. At `100` they are ignored, and the host stops
seeing `moving → stopPending → moving` flap at walking cadence with an event per
flap. Lower it to `66` to let medium-confidence stills through.

None of these can break tracking. An activity label may only *accelerate* a
transition the accepted fixes already justify — it can never veto one — so a real
stop still arrives through the fix path and `stopTimeoutMin` whatever these are
set to. Raising a bar costs you speed, not correctness.

`ready()` returns `invalidConfig` if `stillConfidenceMin` is below
`activityConfidenceMin`: a still that cannot clear the general bar never reaches
the second one, so the setting would otherwise be silently ignored.

Setting `motion.activityRecognition = false` turns the whole input off. Capture
is unaffected — you lose the acceleration, not the tracking.

---

## Diagnostics

When a track looks wrong, the question is *which layer* it first went wrong
in. Three reads answer it, each gated by a `persistence` flag:

```swift
// Layer 1 — unfiltered fixes exactly as CoreLocation delivered them.
// Populated when persistence.persistRawFixes is on.
let raw = try await Tracker.shared.getRawFixes(sessionID: id)

// Layer 3 — every judged fix in point form, accepted or not.
// Populated when persistence.persistRawPoints is on.
let judged = try await Tracker.shared.getRawPoints(sessionID: id)

// The decision log: verdict + reason per fix, with the filter's own estimate
// on each row. Populated when persistence.persistDecisions is on.
let decisions = try await Tracker.shared.getDecisions(sessionID: id, limit: 200)
```

Layer 1 is a ring buffer — `persistence.rawFixRingCapacity`, 50 000 fixes by
default, roughly three days. It is sized so that one parked night cannot evict
the day's driving: CoreLocation keeps delivering while stationary, so a stop
costs rows at the same rate as a drive.


And one write: `offerFix(_:)` feeds a fix from a source the SDK does not own
(an external GPS, a replay). It is judged by the same pipeline as every other
fix — a host cannot inject an unvalidated point:

```swift
await Tracker.shared.offerFix(fix)   // TrackFix
```

### Recording a fixture

`exportFixture(sessionID:name:)` serialises a session's layer-1 fixes as
fixture JSON — the same format the engine's replay suite runs against. It is
how an anomaly seen in the field becomes a regression test.

```swift
let json = try await Tracker.shared.exportFixture(
    sessionID: id,
    name: "roundabout-drift"
)
```

- **It ships in release builds**, unlike the replay harness. A recorder that
  exists only in debug cannot record the one thing worth recording — an anomaly
  on a real device, against the build the user actually has.
- **It returns the JSON rather than writing a file.** Where it belongs is your
  question: attach it to a bug report, or write it to disk yourself.
- **It requires `persistence.persistRawFixes`.** Layer 1 is the input; with the
  flag off the fixture comes back with an empty `fixes` array.
- The fixture's `expected` array is empty by design. Verdicts are read and
  pasted in by hand after review — one blessed without reading locks in a bug.

---

### Battery

Three ways in, all answering the same first question of any field gap: *did
tracking stop because the OS killed us, or because the phone was at 3 %?*

```swift
// One reading, right now. No ready(), no session, no permission needed —
// a diagnostics screen asks this before anything is running.
let battery = Tracker.shared.batteryInfo()

// Every transition, current value replayed immediately on attach.
for await battery in Tracker.shared.batteryState() {
    print("\(battery.percent ?? -1)% charging=\(battery.isCharging as Any)")
}

// Or off the main event stream.
case .batteryChange(let battery):
    print("battery \(battery.percent ?? -1)%")
```

`BatteryInfo`:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `percent` | `Int?` | 0…100, or `nil` when the platform will not say |
| `isCharging` | `Bool?` | `nil` when the platform will not say |
| `powerSource` | `PowerSource` | `.none` on battery, `.unknown` otherwise. iOS never reports `.ac`, `.usb` or `.wireless` |
| `isLow` | `Bool` | Derived from `percent` by the SDK, so no host hardcodes the threshold. `false` when `percent` is `nil` |

**`nil` is not zero, and `nil` is not `false`.** The simulator, a Mac running
your tests, and a device with battery monitoring off all report `nil`. Writing
`percent ?? 0` renders an unknown battery as a flat one — the single most
misleading thing this type can be made to say.

**`batteryChange` and `powerSaveChange` are different facts.** The first is the
battery itself; the second is the Low Power Mode switch, which also appears as
`ProviderState.lowPowerMode`. A user at 80 % who turned Low Power Mode on by
hand is not low, so `isLow` deliberately ignores it.

Events arrive on transition only, deduped on `Equatable`. iOS posts a
notification for every 1 % step and again whenever a cable moves; forwarding
that raw would flood a bridge.

## Licensing

The SDK is licensed per app. A licence token is issued for your bundle
identifier (plus its `.dev`/`.staging` variants) and checked once, in
`ready()`, entirely offline — the app starts without ever reaching the
network. A separate background check asks whether the licence has since
been withdrawn; it blocks nothing and never sends location data. See
[The revocation check](#the-revocation-check). Licences are
permanent: one purchase, no renewals.

**Development needs no token.** The simulator and any build run from Xcode
skip the check, so you can evaluate the whole SDK before buying. A token is
required only in distributed builds: App Store, TestFlight, ad-hoc and
enterprise.

### Getting a licence

Send us the bundle identifier of the app that will ship (for example
`com.acme.delivery`), plus any dev/staging variants. You receive a one-line
token back:

```
TRACKIT-eyJ…
```

### Installing it

Two ways. Pick one — the SDK checks the token in `ready()` either way.

**Option A — Info.plist (recommended).** Open your target's **Info.plist**,
add a row with key `TrackerLicense`, and paste the whole token as its value:

```xml
<key>TrackerLicense</key>
<string>TRACKIT-eyJ…</string>
```

Your `ready()` call then stays exactly as it is — no code change:

```swift
await Tracker.shared.ready()

// or with a config — no .license() needed, the plist key is found automatically:
await Tracker.shared.ready(
    TrackerConfig.builder()
        .accuracyProfile(.balanced)
        .buildUnchecked()
)
```

**Option B — in code, no Info.plist entry.** Pass the token with the config:

```swift
await Tracker.shared.ready(
    TrackerConfig.builder()
        .license("TRACKIT-eyJ…")
        .buildUnchecked()
)
```

Use this when the token arrives at runtime — from your own backend, or a
build system that injects it. When both are set, `.license()` wins over the
plist.

The token is not a secret — it only works for the bundle identifiers it was
issued for — so committing it in the plist is fine. Each app needs its own.

<details>
<summary>Keeping it in an xcconfig (optional refinement of Option A)</summary>

If you prefer build settings over a literal in the plist — for example, a
different token per configuration — put it in a Configuration Settings File:

1. **File ▸ New ▸ File… ▸ Configuration Settings File**, name it
   `Config.xcconfig`.
2. In it, one line: `TRACKER_LICENSE = TRACKIT-eyJ…`
3. Select the project (blue icon) ▸ **Info** tab ▸ **Configurations** →
   expand Debug and Release → set your app target's configuration file to
   `Config`.
4. In Info.plist, set `TrackerLicense` to `$(TRACKER_LICENSE)` — Xcode
   substitutes the real value at build time.

</details>

### If `ready()` refuses

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `licenseMissing` | No token found | Purchase a licence for this app |
| `licenseInvalid` | Token malformed or altered | Re-copy the token from the issue email; the message says what failed |
| `licenseBundleMismatch` | The licence is not valid for this app | Check which target you built, or request a licence for its bundle identifier |

A refused `ready()` never crashes: it returns the code and message in
`TrackerResult`, and your app decides what to show.

Two further codes arrive **later**, as `.error` events rather than from
`ready()`, because they come from the licence server rather than the offline
gate. Tracking has already stopped by the time either lands:

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `licenseRevoked` | Withdrawn by the vendor | Contact support |
| `licenseExpired` | A trial passed its end date | Buy a plan — the same token resumes |

Both also arrive as `licenseDeactivated(status:reason:)`, which carries the
admin's note. Once either fires, `start()` is refused until the server reports
the licence active again.

---

### The revocation check

The gate above is offline and stays offline — `ready()` never waits on the
network to start, because an SDK that does will not start on a train. But a
token carries no expiry and never will: it is a signed statement about an app
id, not a lease. So it cannot answer "has this licence been withdrawn since it
was issued?"

That question goes to the licence server, on **every** `ready()`, on a
background task that blocks nothing:

```swift
case .licenseDeactivated(let status, let reason):
    // Tracking has already stopped by the time this arrives.
    showAlert("Your licence is \(status). \(reason ?? "")")
```

`status` is `revoked` (withdrawn by an admin) or `expired` (a trial past its end
date). The SDK calls `stop()` first and emits second, so a host reacting to the
event never finds a tracker still running behind it.

**Everything else keeps running.** No network, a reply that fails its signature
check, a reply about somebody else's licence, a server error, a rate limit — all
of them leave the tracker recording. The offline gate already proved the licence
was genuine, and a phone in a tunnel is not a piracy problem: stopping there
would throw away location data that no retry can recover.

Nothing about your location data goes to the licence server. The request is the
token, your bundle identifier, `ios`, the SDK version and a random nonce — there
is no endpoint that would accept a coordinate.

## The example app

`Examples/SampleApp` is a complete diagnostic host: the permission ladder, a
live map, a decision log, and a three-layer overlay that shows raw fixes, the
filter's estimate and what was actually stored.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fieldtrack360/tracker-ios
open tracker-ios/Examples/SampleApp/SampleApp.xcodeproj
```

It resolves the frameworks from the repository you just cloned, so it always
matches the version you checked out — nothing is downloaded a second time.

Before it will run on a device:

1. Select the **SampleApp** target ▸ Signing & Capabilities
2. Pick your team, and change the bundle identifier from
   `com.example.tracker.sample` to one you own
3. Update `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` in
   `SampleApp/Resources/Info.plist` if you change the identifier prefix

The simulator runs it without signing, but background relaunch, region
monitoring and the motion sensors only behave correctly on a real device.

### Road snapping in the example

The Snap toggle stays inert until you supply an endpoint. There is no default
on purpose.

```bash
cd Examples/SampleApp/SampleApp/Resources
cp Sample.xcconfig.example Sample.xcconfig    # then set OSRM_BASE_URL
```

### What to read first

## Support

Open an issue on this repository. A `CaptureLog` export from the run
(**Home ▸ Dump session**) makes almost any report diagnosable; a description of
the route usually does not.
